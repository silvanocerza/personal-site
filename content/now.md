Just a page that tells you what am up to [now][nownownow], obviously inspired by [Derek Sivers][derek-sivers]

## Work

It's one whole year that I've been working at [**deepset**][deepset-website] in the Core Team. It's really cool being part of a company that is part of the changes brought by LLMs and AI. Just hoping the bubble doesn't burst.

## Life

Moved to [**Matera**][matera-wiki] recently, the city with the [**Sassi**][sassi-wiki]. It's certainly something living this close to an UNESCO site.
I'm enjoying the change of pace from **Turin**.

## Reading

I'm not reading too much these days but I keep buying loads of books, I have so much space to fill in my bookcase.

Though I'm slowly reading **E giustizia per tutti**, part of the series of books "Cose spiegate bene" from **il Post** newspaper and **Iperborea**. It talks about the italian judicial system, it's inner workings, its flaws, etc.
