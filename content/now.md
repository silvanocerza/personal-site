Just a page that tells you what am up to [now][nownownow], obviously inspired by [Derek Sivers][derek-sivers]

## Work

As of now it's almost one year that I've started working at **Arduino** in the Tooling Team. I've already learned a lot in just one year and am enjoying my time, am working with lots of awesome and knowledgeable people.

## Life

In the past months I've started shooting and developing film photography again, it's something that I missed quite a bit in the last years; also shooting more digitally. Thinking about buying an enlarger to print a bit or even a scanner.

With the easing of COVID restrictions in Italy am thinking to cancel my rent and start hopping from city to city while I keep working, I just need a laptop after all. Am still not sure, thinking about it, need to understand if it's economically feasible. Or I might buy an house, who knows. ðŸ¤·

## Reading

Am always reading something, I tend to limit the number of technical books to one or two depending on the "load".

Right now am reading the **Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools** AKA **The Dragon Book**, seems like a great interesting technical read. I think it will pay off.

Also I started some months ago **Il Decameron** by **Giovanni Boccaccio**, a classical of italian literature; it fits with the pandemic theme. Am enjoying it but the archaic italian makes is kinda hard and slow to read.

Recently instead I picked up **Psychonet** by **Eleonora De Conciliis**, a philosophical take on how the internet influences the human mind and its evolution. I probably lack some background to understand it fully but nonetheless it has some interesting idea.
