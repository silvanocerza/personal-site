Just a page that tells you what am up to [now][nownownow], obviously inspired by [Derek Sivers][derek-sivers]

## Work

As of now it's more than one year that I've started working at **Arduino** in the Tooling Team. Am getting more and more knowledgable about more and more projects and am really enjoying all the technical side of it, there's ton of space for improvements and things to do. I feel like am making an impact.

## Life

I kinda moved to Turin a couple of months ago, am enjoying my time but not sure how much I'll stay. The perks of remote working remotely I guess. I thinking of moving in the mountains.

## Reading

Am always reading something, I tend to limit the number of technical books to one or two depending on the "load".

Right now am reading the **Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools** AKA **The Dragon Book**, seems like a great interesting technical read. I think it will pay off.

Am also reading **Salire in montagna** by **Luca Mercalli**, it's a sort of diary on the difficulties of moving into the mountains, buying an house, renovating it, making sustainable for the future and this kind of things. It's really interesting on the technical side but I don't like some of the author's opinions.

I've started reading **Dune** by **Frank Herbert** too, it's not disappointing me at all, I love Sci-fi after all.
