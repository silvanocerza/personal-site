I get often asked about my career, mostly during job interviews to tell you the truth. Though some times a colleague happens to ask about it too.
As of the time I'm writing this I have almost 9 years of experience on my resume, I wouldn't it consider it that remarkable but it's a good resume. I might obviously be biased. 

There are a good amount of stories in there too, but the best one is probably how I actually landed my first job.

I like to throw around the fact that I dropped out of high school, it catches people off guard more often than not. I kinda get a kick out of it to be fair.
