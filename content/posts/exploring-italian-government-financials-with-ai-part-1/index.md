This post is an adaption of a talk I gave at the DevFest Bari in 2024.

You might be wondering why someone like me is talking about a whole government finance.
Am I some kind of authority in the field? Did I study economy? Or finance?

Obviously not! I have an extremely basic knowledge in economy, and some of could also be completely and utterly wrong.

It's kind of strange story really, though quite typical I bet.
Everyone living in a modern democracy must have though at least once "AH! If I was there! Things would work!"

That's where the idea comes from.

I'm not a fan of the current italian government, I despise it even. And we can sadly avoid talking about the previous ones too.

I kinda like living in Italy, despite all the problems, and would love if I could keep doing that.
Way to many issues are swept under the rug. Fundamental humans rights are getting squashed left and right. The climate crisis is getting ignored. Rich people are getting richer and richer and poor people are getting poorer and poorer. Access to basic national healthcare is getting harder and pricier. And this just to name a few.

To sum it up Italy is slowly becoming a place that I struggle to see myself living in the foreseeable future. So a bit egotistically I thought I could be the driver of a change that would fix those problems that push people out.

So I started thinking of ways that I could bring this wind of change.

Armed insurrection is kinda risky and frowned upon by the public opinion.
We already had our Lead Years and the power tensions between fascists and communists.
So I discarded this idea.

Activism, civil disobedience and even peaceful protests are being limited and criminalised more and more by the current government.
So I discarded this one too.

In the end I thought that maybe I could found a policital party.
I'm a huge believer of fighting systems from the inside, disrupting existing structures from within is a great idea in my opinion.

So I settled on that and started to search for more detailed informations. Turns out that founding a policital party is pretty easy, you just need two persons and a notary to ufficialize it. To be eligible in the Italian parliament you need to gather only 73.500 signatures. The requirements are even lower for regional and municipal electoral lists.

Small spoiler. I still have not found a party at the time of this writing.

In any case I started thinking of a name, the party line, its statute, its ideals, prominent people that could be good candidates. Things like that.

That was all fun and games, at least until I reached a critical point. I was thinking about possibles reforms, some concrete actions. Enhance the healthcare system, public trasportation, a better management of immigration flows, more funding for scientific research.

That was the moment that I asked myself "how do I find the money!?"
