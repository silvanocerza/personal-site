In this talk, I tell the story of how my team started using Datadog in an unusual way to monitor the success of one of the most important of its Open Source projects, the Arduino CLI, by gathering download information from different sources and monitoring build failures. I also explore some of the next steps we can take to gain insight into our other projects.
